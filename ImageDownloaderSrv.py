####### Instructions
Task

Implement a web service with a REST interface (preferably in python). The service should offer 3 REST operations.

1) upload of a list of image urls and download of the corresponding images

Given a list of image urls. When the user sends this list to the service via http, the service starts downloading the images. The service puts the images into a storage, so that they can be listed by and retrieved from the service, see below operation 2) & 3). There is no need to handle download errors: should a link to the image be wrong or the image can not be downloaded, it is just left out. The storage should be persistent, i.e. not in memory.

2) get list of available images

When the user calls this operation via http,the service replies with a list of all images that had been (sucessfully) processed via calls to the previous operation 1). 

3) retrieve an image

Given that there were previously images processed via operation 1), when the user calls this operation with an url as an input-parameter, then the service sends the corresponding image, if it was stored previously via operation 1).

Throughout operation 1)-3), the key of images should always be the full url that was used in the original input list for operation 1)
